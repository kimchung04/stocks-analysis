### Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the stock performances of a given database of stocks using the most efficient coding method. The analysis will show how active a stock is by showing how often a stock is traded throughout the day by calculating the Total Daily Volume, it will also show the yearly return of each stock by looking at its starting and ending prices for the year.
#### Results:
###### Execution Times:
As you can see above, the refactored times for 2018 and 2017 were faster than the times for the original code. In 2017 the original code ran in 0.35 seconds and the refactored code ran in 0.24 seconds. 
###### Refactored Code:
Now if we look at the stocks, we will see that it had a better return in 2017 than in 2018. TERP has a small grown, however it still the only stock that has not have a positive return within two years. AY is the stock had a much smaller lost. This analysis also show that the two best stocks to invest in were ‘ENPH’ and ‘RUN’ because they had growth both years.
#### Summary:
##### The advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code:
